# Validation Evidence Index

> Status: template and registry structure. Populate this file with real
> study/model entries as validation runs are completed and reviewed.

## Purpose

This index ties real results to exact software, configuration, workflow, data,
and model artifacts. It is the regulatory bridge between product controls and
clinical or analytical performance claims.

**When to add a package:** after a `samd_pivotal` (or equivalent) run that used a
populated `pivotal_validation` partition, freeze readiness go/go_with_risks, and
a reviewed intended-use statement. Operator path:
[`../usage/18-samd-study-lifecycle.md`](../usage/18-samd-study-lifecycle.md).
Example partition shapes: [`../examples/samd/`](../examples/samd/).

Architecture and release controls show that the product is controlled. This
index shows what evidence was produced by a specific controlled version.

## Evidence Principles

Each evidence package should be:

- version-bound: exact release bundle and component versions,
- configuration-bound: exact study, site, profile, and DomainProgram inputs,
- instance-bound: workflow instance IDs and node execution exports,
- data-bound: cohort/sample IDs and validation partitions,
- artifact-bound: model, panel, readiness, prediction, and metric outputs,
- limitation-aware: caveats and residual risks documented with the result.

## Current Evidence Packages

| Evidence Package | Product Release | Study / Claim | Status | Primary Result Location |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|-------------------------|
| EV-PCA-PLASMA-2026-06 | `/work/epimethyl/current` manifest `2026.06.1` | Plasma healthy vs PCa (cfDNA); **feasibility only** | draft — engineering/feasibility | `/work/projects/prostate-cancer/Plasma_healthy_vs_PCa/` |
| EV-PCA-HGOOD-2026-06 | `/work/epimethyl/current` manifest `2026.06.1` | H_PCa_good buffy; **feasibility only** | draft — engineering/feasibility | `/work/projects/prostate-cancer/H_PCa_good/` |
| EV-PCA-BUFFY-2026-07 | `/work/epimethyl/current` manifest `2026.06.1` | Buffy healthy vs PCa; **feasibility only** | draft — incomplete model chain | `/work/projects/prostate-cancer/Buffy_healthy_vs_PCa/` |

> **Claim boundary:** All three packages are **feasibility / expanded-development engineering evidence**.
> Study manifests have `regulatory.stage: feasibility`, **no** `validation_partitions`, and
> `allow_clinical_performance_claims` must remain false. They are **not** pivotal clinical
> performance evidence. See [`samd-submission-scaffold.md`](samd-submission-scaffold.md).
>
> **Profile provenance:** New packages should record both `pipelineProfile` and `researchMode`
> (e.g. `samd_research` + `dual_fc`). Legacy `mc_*` names fold into those modes; historical
> runs below may only list the MC snapshot path.

- Freeze readiness AR: present (`result_code: 0`)
- Production / locked model / PCCP under `monte_carlo_runs/production/`: **absent**
- Post-model validation: **absent**

### Deviations and Limitations

- Required follow-up: complete freeze/model; partitions; SaMD ladder

## Gap list (ops follow-up)

1. Populate `validation_partitions` on live prostate manifests (patient-disjoint `locked_test`, later `pivotal_validation`).
2. Re-run enrichment/pivotal tiers with `samd_holdout_enrichment` / `samd_pivotal` when cohorts allow.
3. Bind release manifest SHA256 + CI JUnit into each package at approval.
4. Complete Buffy freeze→model chain before elevating that package.

## Minimum Evidence Set For A Model Claim

Before a model claim is presented externally, the evidence package should include
at minimum:

- release manifest and deploy record,
- frozen study/profile/program/site inputs,
- sample prep and QC summary,
- stability summary and stable panel,
- production freeze summary,
- biological readiness report,
- final classifier and predictor artifacts,
- true holdout evaluation when available,
- bootstrap confidence intervals for primary metrics,
- node execution export and worker action timeline,
- documented limitations and decision rationale.

## Real Results vs Demonstrations

Smoke runs, synthetic fixtures, and development demos are useful engineering
evidence but should not be presented as clinical or analytical validation. They
belong in CI and development-readiness records.

Regulatory evidence requires real cohorts, declared partitions, locked outputs,
and traceability to the deployed product version that produced the results.
