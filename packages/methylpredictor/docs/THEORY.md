# MethylPredictor Theoretical Foundation

The canonical mathematical and statistical reference for this package is the Quarto chapter [`docs/theory/chapters/05-methylpredictor-and-validation.qmd`](../../../docs/theory/chapters/05-methylpredictor-and-validation.qmd).

## Scope

`methylpredictor` is the application and evaluation layer for trained classifiers. It does not fit a new methylation model. Instead it:

- runs a classifier on labeled or blind sample sets,
- computes standard classification metrics when labels are present,
- summarizes predictive uncertainty when labels are absent.

## Method Status

- **Principled**: accuracy, balanced accuracy, confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1, entropy summaries.
- **Operational**: project-driven path resolution and batch prediction workflows.

## Key Point

Blind-mode entropy is an uncertainty summary, not a performance estimate. Any discrimination claim requires labeled evaluation data.
