# MethylCentroid Implementation

## Layers

The implementation is split across two packages:

- `methyl_centroid`: the runner/orchestrator, CLI, config models, batch logic,
  and project resolution.
- `methyl_utils`: the builder, centroid data object, HDF5 I/O, GPU utilities,
  and downstream ECDF comparison helpers.

## Build Pipeline

```text
user config / CLI / project
  -> methyl_centroid.MethylCentroid
  -> methyl_utils.core.centroid_builder.MethylCentroidBuilder
  -> methyl_utils.core.methyl_frame.MethylCentroid
  -> HDF5 centroid ({chrom}-{ctx}.h5)
```

## Runner Responsibilities

`methyl_centroid.MethylCentroid` is responsible for:

- resolving sample directories to `{sample_dir}/{chrom}-{ctx}.h5`
- applying the public cohort contract:
  `samples`, `add_samples`, `remove_samples`
- validating that `binned_stats_bins >= 1`
- invoking the builder
- writing metadata and the sidecar config

The active cohort is resolved deterministically before the build:

```text
effective_samples = samples - remove_samples + add_samples
```

That resolved cohort is then processed for the current chromosome/context.

## CPU Path

The CPU path is implemented with NumPy/pandas accumulation in
`methyl_utils.core.centroid_builder.MethylCentroidBuilder`.

Key points:

- samples are streamed one at a time with `add_sample(...)`
- positions are aligned into a sorted union
- sufficient statistics are accumulated per position
- per-position ECDF histograms are accumulated into `bin_counts`
- `finalize()` returns a CPU `MethylCentroid` data object

For large contexts, the runner can also use chunked recomputation over position
windows to limit peak memory use.

## GPU Path

The GPU path uses CuPy through the same builder interface:

- `use_gpu=True` requests GPU acceleration
- if GPU support is unavailable, the code falls back to CPU
- accumulation still targets the same sufficient statistics and histogram schema
- finalized centroids are converted back to CPU objects before persistence

The CPU and GPU paths intentionally share the same output contract so downstream
consumers do not need separate code paths.

## Data Object

The persisted centroid type is
`methyl_utils.core.methyl_frame.MethylCentroid`.

It stores:

- `pos`, `tnc`
- `N`, `Sx`, `Sx2`
- `Sm`, `Su`, `Sc2`, `Swx2`
- required `binned_stats` (`bin_edges`, `bin_counts`) in memory

The HDF5 format stores:

- datasets under `methylation_data/`
- `methylation_data.attrs["bins"]`
- `methylation_data["bin_counts"]`

Load and save boundaries now require valid positive-bin ECDF data for centroids.

## Incremental Operations

There are two update layers:

- runner-level updates: resolve the final cohort from `samples`,
  `add_samples`, and `remove_samples`, then build that cohort for the target
  chromosome/context
- data-level updates: `MethylCentroid.add_sample(...)` and
  `MethylCentroid.remove_sample(...)` update a centroid object in memory

The runner re-applies `min_coverage` and `min_samples` semantics after sample
mutation so the result matches a full rebuild contract.

## Downstream Consumers

- `MethylCentroidPair` expects centroids with matching ECDF histogram bins and
  compares them with the ECDF-only path.
- `MethylDetector` builds on `MethylCentroidPair` and no longer accepts runtime
  distribution-selection knobs for centroid comparison. Its current ECDF
  utilities also reuse centroid `bin_counts`, while heterogeneity-oriented
  filters can consume stored `Sc2` and `Swx2`.
- `MethylValidation` can emit per-group centroid step overrides so each run
  passes explicit `samples`, `add_samples`, and `remove_samples` deltas.

## Config Defaults

The supported default for `binned_stats_bins` is `20`.

That default is aligned across:

- `MethylCentroidConfig`
- `MethylCentroidBuilder`
- direct CLI usage
- documentation examples

## Summary

Implementation-wise, the current contract is:

- one runner class
- one centroid data class
- one required ECDF histogram schema
- one supported centroid-comparison mode
