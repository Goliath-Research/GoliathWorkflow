# MethylUtils Usage Guide

## Overview

MethylUtils is primarily a **library** used by the other MethylPipeline packages (MethylCentroid, MethylDetector, MethylClassifier, MethylPredictor). You install MethylUtils first; then you install and run those tools. There are **two ways** to have MethylUtils available:

1. **Docker container** — Use the MethylPipeline image; MethylUtils is pre-installed.
2. **Local host with virtual environment** — Create a venv, activate it, and install MethylUtils (then install any other package you need).

Use one or the other; once MethylUtils is available, the other packages use it the same way.

---

## Setup 1: Docker container

Use this when you want a single, reproducible environment (e.g. shared GPU, CI, or no local Python install).

**Prerequisites:** Docker; for GPU, NVIDIA Container Toolkit.

**1. Start the container**

From the MethylPipeline repo:

```bash
cd /path/to/MethylPipeline/docker
docker compose up -d
```

(Use the same container name as in your compose file; below assumes `methylpipeline` and the repo mounted at `/workspace`.)

**2. MethylUtils inside the container**

MethylUtils is already installed in the image. When you run MethylCentroid, MethylDetector, MethylClassifier, or MethylPredictor inside the container (e.g. via `docker exec ...`), they use this MethylUtils. You do not need to install MethylUtils separately.

**3. Optional: run MethylUtils tests**

From the host:

```bash
docker exec -w /workspace methylpipeline pytest packages/methylutils/ -v
```

Paths must be valid inside the container (e.g. `/workspace/...`).

## Setup 2: Local host with virtual environment

Use this when you run on the host (e.g. your laptop or a login node) and want to activate a virtual environment before running any pipeline tool.

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+ (repository target is `<3.13`). Optional: CuPy for GPU acceleration.

**1. Create a virtual environment**

From the **MethylPipeline repository root** (canonical directory is `.venv`):

```bash
cd /path/to/MethylPipeline
python3.12 -m venv .venv
```

**2. Activate the virtual environment**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`. After activation, your shell prompt usually shows `(.venv)`.

**3. Install MethylUtils first**

From the MethylPipeline repo root:

```bash
pip install -e packages/methylutils
```

Or from the package directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/MethylPipeline/packages/methylutils
pip install -e .
```

**4. Optional: GPU support**

If you have CUDA and want GPU acceleration for metrics and heavy processing:

```bash
pip install cupy-cuda12x   # adjust to your CUDA version (e.g. cupy-cuda11x)
```

**5. Install other packages as needed**

MethylCentroid, MethylDetector, MethylClassifier, and MethylPredictor **all require MethylUtils to be installed first**. After MethylUtils is installed, install any of them, for example:

```bash
pip install -e packages/methylcentroid
pip install -e packages/methyldetector
pip install -e packages/methylclassifier
pip install -e packages/methylpredictor
```

Each of those packages has its own [USAGE](../../methylcentroid/docs/USAGE.md) (or equivalent) for their CLI and options; they all assume MethylUtils is already available in the environment.

## Install order summary

| Order | Package | Note |
|-------|---------|------|
| 1 | **MethylUtils** | Required by all others. |
| 2 | MethylCentroid, MethylDetector, MethylClassifier, MethylPredictor | Any subset; can be installed in any order after MethylUtils. |

## Opt-in M-value residualization

Do **not** enable residualization from `primary_analyte: buffy_coat`. Pick procedure `buffy_wgbs_mvalue_residual_gene_fc` (forked lifecycle). Operator chapter: [usage ch.24](../../../docs/usage/24-methylation-application-packs.md). Per-confounder mechanics: [M-value residualization implementation](../../../docs/implementation/mvalue-residualization.md).

CLIs (same `--resolved-config` contract as other worker actions):

| CLI | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `methyl-confounder-scores` | `pipeline.methylation_confounder_scores` |
| `methyl-residualize-fit` | `pipeline.residualize_fit` |
| `methyl-residualize-sensitivity` | Compare unadjusted vs residualized DMP / gene panels |

The packaged age covariate is Hannum 2013 (`hannum2013_v1.json`), not a product DNAmAge. Overlay a different clock with `actionConfig.methylation_confounder_scores.age_clock_path`.
